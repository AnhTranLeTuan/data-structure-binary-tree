# Data Structure: Binary Tree

## Description
Experiment with concepts of binary tree, or the sorted binary tree in specific. In this project, we can see how:
* Create attributes of the the sorted binary tree
* Insert the element in to the binary tree
* Check to see if a specific item is contained in the binary tree
* Remove the specific item from the binary tree
* Pre-order depth first traversal
* In-order depth first traversal
* Post-order depth first traversal
* Level-order depth first traversal
* Depth of the specific item in the binary tree
* Height of the specific item in the binary tree
* Minimum value for the sorted tree
* Minimum value for the unsorted tree (Although this binary tree is sorted, this method is for the assumption that it is not sorted)
* Compare two binary tree to see if they are equal
* Check if this binary tree is the binary search tree, or is this tree sorted (assume we don't know is is sorted or not)
* Nodes at K distance
